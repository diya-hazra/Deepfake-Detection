# Deepfake Detection Using YOLOv8 
A deepfake detection system built using YOLOv8, focused on classifying real vs. fake video frames. This project includes a custom pipeline for dataset preparation, frame extraction, and image classification using deep learning. Trained on real and manipulated video datasets to identify deepfake artifacts with high accuracy. Suitable for real-time image-based deepfake detection tasks.
